I am a Fulbright Scholar and MA Candidate in Social Sciences at the Juan March Institute of Social Sciences at Carlos III Unversity of Madrid. I recevied a BBA in International Business with an emphasis in Economics.

As an economic sociologist, my research primarily focuses on the sociology of work in postindustrial economies. I am particularly interested in occupational structure, technological change, and shifting labor market demographics. You can download my full CV here.
